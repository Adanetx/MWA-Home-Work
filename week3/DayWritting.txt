 1- Why do we say Node uses an Event-Driven-Architecture?
answer: the reason we say node is Event-Driven-Loop is, we use event-loop for node
 to perform none blocking operation. even if javascript is single threaded we can use event loop to perform none blcoking operations.

2, Can you write Node code that is not event driven? Why? yes I can write because if I did not want to pass call back, I do not need event driven.

layout tree are what are going are going to layer trees
